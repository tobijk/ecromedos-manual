			If you are the type of person whom the typical word processor drives out
		of their mind. If your blood pressure goes up, when a piece of software tries
		to be smart about every single key press you make, even interpreting the
		backspace key in a myriad of ways that you never expected. Or if you find
		yourself spending more time on reformatting your documents than doing actual
		writing, then ecromedos might be just for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is about a piece of software that can change your life as
		a technical writer and restore your belief in the power of the backspace key,
		for good. Making use of modern technologies, but building on proven concepts
		that stem from the early days of computing, ecromedos is a text processing system
		of a different kind. If you are ready to break with old habits and willing to
		learn something new, then I hope you will find that ecromedos can render you
		more productive by letting you focus on writing, and nothing else.

			<title>What is ecromedos?</title>
			<p>
				ecromedos is an integrated solution for XML-based publishing in print and
			on the Web. It is primarily targeted at, but not limited to, the creation of
			technical documentation in the field of Computer Science. Documents are written
			in a semantic markup language and converted to representational formats with a
			special processing toolchain. Currently, ecromedos supports the target formats
			XHTML and &latex;, where the latter can be compiled into high-quality PostScript
			or PDF by use of the &tex;<footnote>More information on &tex; and &latex; can be
			found on the <i>Comprehensive &tex; Archive Network</i> at
			<link url="http://www.ctan.org"><tt>http://&zwsp;www.&zwsp;ctan.&zwsp;org</tt></link>.</footnote>
			typesetting system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <i>ecromedos Markup Language</i> (ECML) is modelled closely after HTML
			with some ideas and additional elements borrowed from &latex;. It lets you
			compose comprehensive, well-structured documents from a comparably small set of
			language elements. Users who are already familiar with HTML or document markup
			languages like DocBook will find learning ECML particularly easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <i>ecromedos Document Processor</i> (eDP) uses XSL Transformations
			(XSLT) to convert source documents from ECML to the supported output formats.
			In addition, the eDP contains a specialized pre-processor, which operates
			directly on the	XML-DOM tree of a document and carries out additional
			preparational tasks that could not be implemented with bare XSLT, such as the
			conversion of images to processable formats or on-the-fly syntax-highlighting of
			source code	listings.
			</p>
			<p>
				ecromedos is well-suited for environments where many writers collaborate on
			many documents. Since documents are written in a semantic markup language,
			writers do not have to worry much about following a style guide. There is very
			little coordination required in achieving a consistent layout and look
			over an entire range of documents, because the layouting and formatting is done
			automatically by the eDP and assorted tools during the conversion to
			representational formats.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>What's new in Version 2?</title>
			<p>
				Starting with version 2, ecromedos can be considered a full-blown document
			authoring system. Beside some language clean-ups in the DTD, a couple of new
			features were added that make the new ecromedos much more versatile than version 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most notable deficits of version 1, namely the lack of support for
			glossary and keyword indexes, have been remedied. The new DTD lets you
			make definitions <qq>on the spot</qq>, and place index markers as you are
			writing. The document pre-processor collects all terminological definitions
			and index markers while parsing the document and automatically builds the
			corresponding indexes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table model has been enhanced to allow for table cells to be split into
			subtables. This compensates for the lack of support for cells spanning multiple
			rows. A new pre-processor plugin auto-detects the number of vertical frame rules
			in a table, making it unnecessary to provide explicit hints in the column
			specification of tables.
			</p>
			<p>
				Table cells and list items may now contain arbitrary combinations of block
			elements and are no longer restricted to carrying plain text only. This opens
			up new possibilities for the conversion of complex HTML documents to ecromedos
			Markup Language.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last but not least, some major effort has gone into removing formatting
			information, such as CSS styles, from the XSL stylesheets wherever possible and
			providing central styles definition files. Thus, simple customizations no
			longer require digging into the XSL stylesheets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the new DTD <i>is not</i> backwards compatible to documents
			from version 1.

			<title>About this Document</title>
			<p>
				This document describes the installation and usage of ecromedos and the
			scope of the ecromedos Markup Language. After reading this manual, you will be
			able to write feature-rich documents and translate them to representational
			on-screen or printable formats with the ecromedos Document Processor (eDP).
